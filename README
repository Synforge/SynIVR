Project: SynIVR - An IVR AGI application for Asterisk

DESCRIPTION
===============================================================================

SynIVR provides a full featured IVR system for Asterisk, inspired by
the phpIVR project it includes the following features:

    - Unlimited menus that can be nested in any way.

    - Ability to navigate between menus at any point.

    - Can perform a set of actions (play prompt, play music, navigate 
      between menus, etc.) when the user enters a menu, presses a button
      or a combination of buttons.

    - Dynamic input that can be passed to asterisk applications, for        
      example: providing a menu where a user can specify an extension.

    - Keeps track of which menus have been accessed by the user. 
      Includes back action to return to the previous menu.
    
    - Menus can be separated into multiple configuration files.

    - Any asterisk application can be called from the IVR.
